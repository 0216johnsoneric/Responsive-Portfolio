Responsive Portfolio
Welcome to my responsive portfolio! This is a person website designed by me. It includes an index About Me homepage, a Contact message form, and a Portfolio image section of all my favorite food items! The Navagation bar seemlessly links you to each one of the .html files and the CSS adds simple, but eloquent stylings. I hope you enjoy this immersive webpage! 
 
Instructions:
(My github pages is currently not working. I'v talked with the instructor and he told me to note in the homework that my pages URL http://arahants.io/Responsive-Portfolio/ is not working. I am actively working with github support to try to reset the pages link to the 0216johnson.github.io. I am also working with the tutors on BCS. The one tutor I had on saturday was not able to figure out how to reset it with me in the 40min session.)
1) Clone lab: git clone git@github.com:0216johnsoneric/Responsive-Portfolio.git
2) Run in Browser w/ localhost or VS code browser extension
