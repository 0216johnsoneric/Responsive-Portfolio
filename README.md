Responsive Portfolio
Welcome to my responsive portfolio! This is a person website designed by me. It includes an index About Me homepage, a Contact message form, and a Portfolio image section of all my favorite activities! The Navagation bar seemlessly links you to each one of the .html files and the CSS adds simple, but eloquent stylings. I hope you enjoy this immersive webpage! I have a portfolio of my favorite food items!
